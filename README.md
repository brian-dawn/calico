A tool that slides your [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) theme.

Hosted on [SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/~brian-dawn/calico) but also hosted on [Github](https://github.com/brian-dawn/calico) for convenience. If you're curious why SourceHut is neat check out [this](https://sourcehut.org/blog/2019-10-23-srht-puts-users-first/).

## Requirements

You need to allow kitty to be remote controlled. One way to do this is to add:

    allow_remote_control yes

To your `~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf` file.
